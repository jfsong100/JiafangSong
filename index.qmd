I am a fifth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Abhirup Datta](https://abhidatta.com). My research focuses on variational inference and machine learning methods. I previously earned an MS in Biostatistics from Yale University. I graduated from Peking University in Beijing, China, in 2018 with a B.S. in Pharmaceutical Sciences and a double major in Econimics.
